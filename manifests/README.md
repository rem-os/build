# The Manifest File:
--------------

RemOS includes several manifest files in this directory which may be referenced for examples of usable build manifests.
which can be customized with the following JSON settings:

### version
The JSON manifest has a version control string which must be set. 

This document corresponds to version "1.1", so any manifest using this specification needs to have the following field in the top-level object of the manifest:

`"version" : "1.1"`

### Distribution Branding
There are a couple options which may be set in the manifest in order to "brand" the distribution of TrueOS.

* **os_name** (string) : Branding name for the distribution.
   * Default Value: "TrueOS"
   * Will change the branding in pc-installdialog, and the distro branding in the bootloader as well.
* **os_version** (string) : Custom version tag for the build. 
   * At build time this will become the "TRUEOS_VERSION" environment variable which can be used in filename expansions and such later (if that environment variable is not already set).

### base-packages
The "base-packages" target allows the configuration of the OS packages itself. This can involve the naming scheme, build flags, extra dependencies, and more.


#### Base Packages Options
* **kernel-flags** and **world-flags** (JSON object) : These are objects containing extra builds flags that will be used for the kernel/world build stages. 
   * **default** (JSON array of strings) : Default list of build flags (required if the object is defined)
   * **ENV_VARIABLE** (JSON array of strings) : Additional list to be added to the "default" list **if** an environment variable with the same name exists.
   * ***WARNING:*** The only kernel flag that should be optionally set here is the "KERNCONF" setting for selecting a custom kernel configuration. All other world/kernel options are exposed via port options on the "buildworld" and "buildkernel" ports and should be modified in the "ports -> make.conf" section of the manifest.
* **strip-plist** (JSON array of strings) :  List of directories or files that need to be removed from the base-packages.
* **trueos-branch** (string) : Supply a branch name from the trueos/trueos github repository to use for the OS branch.
   * This will ensure that all the base packages use the version of the OS that comes from this branch.
   * If unset, the build will use whichever version of the base packages are currently set in the ports tree.

#### Base Packages Example
```
"base-packages" : {
  "world-flags": {
    "default": [
      "WITH_FOO=1",
      "WITH_BAR=2"
    ],
    "ENV_VARIABLE_FOOBAR": [
      "WITH_FOOBAR=1",
      "WITHOUT_FOOBAR2=1"
    ]
  },
  "kernel-flags": {
    "default": [
      "WITH_FOO=1",
      "WITH_BAR=2"
    ],
    "ENV_VARIABLE_FOOBAR": [
      "WITH_FOOBAR=1",
      "WITHOUT_FOOBAR2=1"
    ]
  },
  "strip-plist":[
	  "/usr/share/examples/pc",
	  "/usr/share/examples/ppp"
  ]
}
```

### iso

   * All other types are currently valid but do not trigger any custom configuration routines.
* **size** (string) : Truncate the VM image file according to this option.
   * This string is used as an argument to the "truncate -s [size] ...." command. 
   * Please view the manual page for the "truncate" utility for additional information (`man truncate`).
* **disk-config** (string) : Name of the disk configuration script to use from the [vm-diskcfg directory](https://github.com/trueos/build/master/vm-diskconfig).
   * Example: a value of "zfs-noswap" will use the "vm-diskcfg/zfs-noswap.sh" disk configuration script to setup the VM.
* **boot** (string) : Either "zfs" or "ufs". Use this filesystem for the VM image.
* **auto-install-packages** (JSON object) : Lists of packages (by port origin) to automatically install into the VM image.
   * **NOTE:** If this field is missing, it will use the "iso" version of the "auto-install-packages" field as a fallback list.
   * **default** (JSON array of strings) : Default list (required)
   * **ENV_VARIABLE** (JSON array of strings) : Additional list to be added to the "default" list **if** an environment variable with the same name exists.
* **generate-manifest** (boolean) : If set to true, will generate a "manifest.json" file containing references or contents of all the files in the VM output directory.

#### VM Example

  "size" : "3G",
  "disk-config" : "zfs-noswap",
  "boot" : "zfs"
}
```

### ports
The "ports" target allows for configuring the build targets and options for the ports system. That can include changing the default version for particular packages, selecting a subset of packages to build, and more.

#### Ports Options
* **type** (string) : One of the following: [git, github-tar, svn, tar, local]. Where to look for the ports tree.
* **branch** (string) : Branch of the repository to use (svn/git only)

* **github-repo** (string) : (github-tar type only) Repository to fetch from the GitHub organization
* **github-tag** (string) : (github-tar type only) Either a branch name or a commit tag from the default branch.
   * If a branch name is supplied, then every time the build is run it will check to see if the upstream repo/branch has changed, and update itself as needed
   * If a commit tag is supplied, the it will grab the version of the *default branch* at the designated commit.
* **overlay** (JSON array of objects) : Entries to apply various overlay(s) to the ports tree after it has been checked out.
   * **WARNING** Ports overlay can only be used with the "tar","github-tar", and "local"  ports types.
   * Syntax for objects within the array:
      * "type" : (string) Either "category" (adding a new category to the ports tree) or "port" (adding a single port to the tree)
      * "name" : (string) Category name ("mydistro") or port origin ("devel/myport") depending on the type of overlay.
      * "local_path" : (string) path to the local directory which will be used as the overlay.
* **local_source** (string) : Path to a local directory where the ports tree should be placed (used for reproducible builds). This directory name will be visible in the output of `uname` on installed systems.
* **build-all** (boolean) : Build the entire ports collection (true/false)
* **generate-manifests** (boolean) : Assemble the "pkg-manifests" directory of repo-management files. (true/false)
* **build** (JSON object) : Lists of packages (by port origin) to build. If "build-all" is true, then this list will be treated as "essential" packages and if any of them fail to build properly then the entire build will be flagged as a failure.
   * **default** (JSON array of strings) : Default list (required)
   * **ENV_VARIABLE** (JSON array of strings) : Additional list to be added to the "default" list **if** an environment variable with the same name is set
* **make.conf** (JSON object) : Lists of build flags for use when building the ports.
   * **default** (JSON array of strings) : Default list (required)
   * **ENV_VARIABLE** (JSON array of strings) : Additional list to be added to the "default" list **if** an environment variable with the same name is set
* **strip-plist** (JSON array of strings) : List of files or directories to remove from any packages that try to use them.

  "branch" : "trueos-master",
  "url" : "https://github.com/trueos/trueos-ports",
  "local_source" : "/usr/ports",
  "build-all" : false,
  "generate-manifests" : false,
  "build" : {
    "default" : [
      "sysutils/tmux",

    ]
  },
  "strip-plist":[
	  "/usr/local/share/doc/tmux",
	  "/usr/local/share/examples/tmux"
  ]
}
```

Example of how to use the "github-overlay" type of ports. All the options unrelated to the type are still valid - just not shown in this example.
```
"ports" : {
  "type" : "github-overlay",
  "github-org" : "trueos",
  "github-repo" : "trueos-ports",
  "github-tag" : "trueos-master",
  "github-overlay" : [
    {
      "type" : "category",
      "name" : "mydistro",
      "local_path" : "overlay/mydistro"
    },
    {
      "type" : "port",
      "name" : "devel/myport",
      "local_path" : "overlay/devel/myport"
    }
  ]
}
```

### poudriere
The "poudriere" object allows the configuration of the poudriere build system for individual build manifests, allowing many different builds to be performed on the same system without conflicting with each other.

#### Poudriere Options
* **jailname** (string) : Use this name internally for the jail which is used for the builds.
   * If not provided, the "trueos-mk-base" name will be used.
* **portsname** (string) : Use this name internally for the ports tree used by the build.
   * If not provided, the "trueos-mk-ports" name will be used.

#### Poudriere Example
```
"poudriere" : {
  "jailname" : "my-distro-edge",
  "portsname" : "edge"
}
```

### poudriere-conf
This field contains a list of options to use to configure the poudriere instance that will build the packages. The configuration of poudriere is automatically performed to ensure an optimal result for most build systems, but it is possible to further customize these settings as needed.

#### Poudriere-conf Options
* **poudriere-conf** (JSON array of strings) : List of configuration options for poudriere
* */etc/poudriere.conf.release* - If this file exists on the system, it will be appended as a whole to the auto-generated config.

Common options to configure:

* "NOHANG_TIME=[number]" : Number of seconds a port build can be "silent" before poudriere stops the build.
* "PREPARE_PARALLEL_JOBS=[number]" : Number of CPUs to use when setting up poudriere (typical setting: Number of CPU's - 1)
* "PARALLEL_JOBS=[number]" : Number of ports to build at any given time.
* "ALLOW_MAKE_JOBS=[yes/no]" : Allow ports to build with more than one CPU. 
   * *WARNING:* Make sure to set the "MAKE_JOBS_NUMBER_LIMIT=[number]" in the builds -> make.conf settings to restrict ports to a particular number of CPUs as well.
* USE_TMPFS=[all, yes, wrkdir, data, localbase, no]" : Set how much of the port builds should be performed in memory.

#### Poudriere-conf Example
```
"poudriere-conf": [
	"NOHANG_TIME=14400",
	"PREPARE_PARALLEL_JOBS=15",
	"PARALLEL_JOBS=3",
	"USE_TMPFS='yes'",
	"ALLOW_MAKE_JOBS=yes"
]
```

An example of the automatically-generated config file is included below for reference (if nothing is supplied via the JSON manifest):
```
# Base Poudriere setup for build environment
ZPOOL=${ZPOOL}
FREEBSD_HOST=file://${DIST_DIR}
GIT_URL=${GH_PORTS}
BASEFS=${POUDRIERE_BASEFS}
# Change a couple poudriere defaults to integrate with an automated build
USE_TMPFS=data
ATOMIC_PACKAGE_REPOSITORY=no
PKG_REPO_FROM_HOST=yes
# Optimize the building of known "large" ports (if selected for build)
ALLOW_MAKE_JOBS_PACKAGES="chomium* iridium* gcc* webkit* llvm* clang* firefox* ruby* cmake* rust*"
PRIORITY_BOOST="pypy* openoffice* iridium* chromium*"
```

### pkg-repo
This section determines the default package repository configuration for the installed system.

#### pkg-repo Options
* **pkg-repo-name** (string) : Short-name for the package repository (default: "TrueOS")
* **pkg-train-name** (string) : Name for the package repository train used by sysutils/sysup (default: "TrueOS")
* **pkg-repo** (JSON Object) : Settings for the package repository
   * **url** (string) : Public URL where the repository can be found. (Distro creators will need to setup access for this URL and copy the pkg repo files as needed to make them available at the given location).
   * **pubKey** (JSON Array of strings) : SSL public key to use when verifying integrity of downloaded packages (one line of test per item in the array). This is basically just the plain-text of the SSL public key file converted into an array of strings. 
      * **WARNING** Make sure that this public key is the complement to the private key which is used to sign the packages!!
   
#### pkg-repo Example

```
"pkg-repo-name" : "TrueOS",
"pkg-train-name" : "snapshot",
"pkg-repo" : {
  "url" : "http://pkg.trueos.org/pkg/release/${ABI}/latest",
  "pubKey : [
